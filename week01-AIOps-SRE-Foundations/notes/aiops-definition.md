AIOps Definition & Overview
1. What is AIOps?

AIOps stands for Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations.
It refers to the use of machine learning (ML) and data science to automate and enhance IT operations, including monitoring, event correlation, root cause analysis (RCA), and predictive insights.

Core idea:

Traditional IT operations produce massive amounts of data from logs, metrics, events, and traces.

AIOps ingests, normalizes, and analyzes this data to detect anomalies, predict outages, and automate remediation.

2. Why AIOps?

Modern IT systems are complex and dynamic, especially in cloud-native environments. Human teams cannot manually process all alerts or detect patterns efficiently.
AIOps solves these problems by:

Reducing alert fatigue

Identifying root causes faster

Enabling predictive maintenance

Supporting auto-remediation and self-healing systems

3. Key Components of AIOps
Component	Purpose
Data Ingestion	Collect metrics, logs, events, and traces from multiple sources
Data Normalization	Standardize data formats to enable analysis
Event Correlation	Detect patterns and link related incidents
Anomaly Detection	Identify unusual behaviors using ML
Root Cause Analysis (RCA)	Automatically pinpoint the source of problems
Prediction & Forecasting	Predict outages, capacity issues, or performance degradation
Automation & Remediation	Trigger scripts, scaling, or alerts based on insights
4. AIOps vs DevOps vs SRE
Aspect	DevOps	SRE	AIOps
Focus	CI/CD & collaboration	Reliability, SLOs, error budgets	AI-driven insights & automation
Scope	Deployment pipelines	Service reliability & observability	Event correlation, anomaly detection, predictive operations
Automation	CI/CD pipelines	Toil reduction	Alerts, RCA, self-healing, predictive scaling
5. Typical AIOps Workflow
1. Collect Data → metrics, logs, traces, events
2. Normalize & Enrich Data
3. Detect anomalies using ML
4. Correlate events and incidents
5. Identify root cause
6. Predict trends or outages
7. Automate remediation or notifications

6. Popular AIOps Tools

Open-source: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + OpenTelemetry, ELK Stack

Enterprise / SaaS: Dynatrace, Moogsoft, Splunk ITSI, Datadog AIOps, New Relic AI

7. Benefits of AIOps

Reduced mean time to detection (MTTD) & recovery (MTTR)

Fewer false-positive alerts

Faster incident response & automated remediation

Proactive capacity planning & scaling

Better operational insights for business decisions
